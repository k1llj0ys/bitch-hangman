REM  Bitch Hangman - Windows launcher
REM
REM  Starts a static web server bound to 127.0.0.1 only (never the network) and
REM  opens the game in the default browser. No admin rights, no downloads, no
REM  internet access required.
REM
REM  Why a server at all? Browsers disable the Web Crypto API (which the game
REM  needs to decrypt words) when a page is opened from file://. Running on
REM  http://127.0.0.1 makes the page a "secure context", which enables both the
REM  crypto API and the offline service-worker cache.
